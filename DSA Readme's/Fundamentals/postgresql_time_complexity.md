# PostgreSQL Operations Time Complexity

## 1. INSERT Operation:

### a) Simple INSERT (without Indexes):
- When inserting data into a table without any indexes, PostgreSQL just appends the data to the table (heap).
- **Time Complexity: O(1)** per row. The cost of inserting a single row is constant, as PostgreSQL just adds it to the end of the table.

### b) INSERT with Indexes:
- If the table has indexes (e.g., B-tree indexes), PostgreSQL needs to update these indexes as well for each row insertion.
- **Time Complexity: O(log n)** for each index (for B-tree), where `n` is the number of rows already in the table.
  - The overall time complexity depends on the number of indexes. For a table with `k` indexes, it becomes **O(k * log n)** for the index updates.

## 2. DELETE Operation:

### a) Simple DELETE (without Indexes):
- If you perform a DELETE on a table without indexes, PostgreSQL will need to perform a **sequential scan** to find the rows that match the WHERE clause.
- **Time Complexity: O(n)**, where `n` is the number of rows in the table (due to the full table scan).

### b) DELETE with Indexes:
- When an index exists on the column(s) in the WHERE clause, PostgreSQL can use the index to quickly locate the rows that need to be deleted.
- **Time Complexity: O(log n)** for the index lookup (for B-tree).
  - After finding the rows, PostgreSQL must also mark the rows as deleted and update any related indexes, which adds additional **O(k * log n)** complexity if the table has `k` indexes.

### c) MVCC Overhead:
- PostgreSQL uses **Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC)**, so deleted rows are not physically removed but marked as dead. The cleanup happens later via a vacuum operation, which can add some overhead.

## 3. SELECT Operation:

### a) Simple SELECT (without Indexes):
- If there’s no index on the columns being queried, PostgreSQL performs a **sequential scan** over the table.
- **Time Complexity: O(n)**, where `n` is the number of rows in the table.

### b) SELECT with Indexes:
- When indexes are available, PostgreSQL can use them to quickly find the relevant rows.
- For a B-tree index, **time complexity is O(log n)**, where `n` is the number of rows.
- For a hash index (used only for equality comparisons), the complexity is **O(1)** for finding the rows.

### c) SELECT with Aggregations or Sorting (ORDER BY):
- Sorting requires **O(n log n)** time if it’s not supported by an index (for example, with an ORDER BY clause).
- Aggregation (`COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, etc.) typically requires scanning the data, so **O(n)** for the scan.

## 4. UPDATE Operation:

### a) Simple UPDATE (without Indexes):
- Similar to DELETE, if there’s no index on the columns involved in the WHERE clause, PostgreSQL has to do a full table scan.
- **Time Complexity: O(n)** for the table scan and **O(1)** to update each row.

### b) UPDATE with Indexes:
- When there’s an index on the column(s) involved in the WHERE clause, PostgreSQL can quickly find the rows using an index lookup.
- **Time Complexity: O(log n)** for the index lookup and **O(1)** for updating the row.
  - If the columns being updated are part of an index, PostgreSQL also needs to update the index, which adds **O(k * log n)** complexity where `k` is the number of indexes.

### c) MVCC Overhead:
- Like DELETE, PostgreSQL doesn’t update rows in place but creates a new version of the row and marks the old one as dead. This adds overhead similar to DELETE.

## 5. Other Operations:

### a) JOIN Operations:
- **Nested Loop Join**: Time complexity is **O(n * m)**, where `n` and `m` are the sizes of the two tables being joined. This is the slowest join method.
- **Hash Join**: Time complexity is **O(n + m)**, where `n` and `m` are the sizes of the tables. This is generally faster but requires building a hash table.
- **Merge Join**: Time complexity is **O(n log n + m log m)**, assuming the tables are sorted. This method can be very efficient for large datasets that are already ordered or indexed.

### b) Index Creation:
- For a B-tree index, the time complexity for creating an index is **O(n log n)**, where `n` is the number of rows in the table.
- Hash indexes have a time complexity of **O(n)** for creation, but they are less commonly used.

### c) VACUUM Operation:
- The VACUUM operation, which is responsible for cleaning up dead tuples (from updates or deletes), has a time complexity of **O(n)**, where `n` is the size of the table.

## Summary of Time Complexities:

| Operation           | Time Complexity Without Index | Time Complexity With Index (B-tree) |
|---------------------|------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **INSERT**          | O(1)                          | O(log n) per index                 |
| **DELETE**          | O(n)                          | O(log n) for index lookup + O(k * log n) for index updates |
| **UPDATE**          | O(n)                          | O(log n) for index lookup + O(k * log n) for index updates |
| **SELECT**          | O(n)                          | O(log n) for index lookup          |
| **ORDER BY**        | O(n log n)                    | O(n) if index supports sorting     |
| **JOIN (Nested Loop)** | O(n * m)                   | Depends on type of join and indexes|
| **JOIN (Hash Join)** | O(n + m)                     | N/A                                |
| **CREATE INDEX**    | O(n log n)                    | N/A                                |
